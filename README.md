# Iris_Classification_Model_Web_Application
It is a Machine Learning Model which is deployed on Heroku Cloud from basic.

Steps From Basics :

1. First Make Your Machine Learning Model , Choose Various Algorithms you need and Make the Pickle Files of Various Algorithms. To make Pickle files, code has been included in        Model.ipynb File.
2. After Making Your Machine Learning Model File, make your webapp file which consists of streamlit module.
3. Various Python Modules required has been included in requirements.txt
4. Setup.sh File is used by streamlit to get access of its credentials..
5. ProcFile ia text document which runs our webapp.ipynb file. It is run by the Heroku.
